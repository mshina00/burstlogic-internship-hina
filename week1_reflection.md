# Week 1 – BurstLogic Internship Reflection

## What I Learned This Week
- Explored the BurstLogic ESG framework and its role in compliance.
- Simulated burst units in R and validated reproducibility using fixed seeds.
- Understood how audit trails and carbon receipts contribute to ESG reporting.

## What I Built or Tested
- Created a reproducible burst simulation scaffold using dplyr and ggplot2.
- Generated burst units and saved outputs in CSV and RDS formats.
- Visualized burst trends across 100 events to support functionality testing.

## Questions I Asked or Still Have
- Where are the official burst simulation scripts and audit log files stored?
- What benchmarks or expected outputs should I validate against?
- Which ESG metrics are tracked in the CRM, and can I help automate updates?

## Skills I’m Strengthening
- R scripting and reproducible data workflows.
- Cybersecurity mindset through audit integrity and hash verification prep.
- ESG compliance awareness and stakeholder reporting structure.

## Goals for Next Week
- Add carbon savings logic to the burst simulation.
- Begin hash verification and metadata validation once files are shared.
- Explore CRM automation workflows and ESG metric integration.
